Air Pollution Detector
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project focuses on building an Air Pollution Detector that measures air quality by detecting harmful gases and particulate matter in the environment. The system collects real-time data using sensors and provides an indication of air pollution levels, which can help raise awareness and support preventive actions.


ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Monitor air quality in real-time.
Detect common pollutants (e.g., COâ‚‚, CO, PM2.5, PM10, etc.).
Provide user-friendly data visualization.
Alert when pollution exceeds safe thresholds.
